## Description

In this project, we focus on cleaning and preparing data scraped from Glassdoor's website for further analysis. Glassdoor provides a valuable dataset of employee reviews and job listings, but it often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and other data quality issues. Our goal is to transform this raw web data into a clean and reliable resource for informed decision-making in the job market and workplace analysis.
