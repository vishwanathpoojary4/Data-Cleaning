    "In the age of information, valuable insights can be gleaned from data scattered across the digital landscape. Glassdoor, a renowned platform for employee reviews and job listings, holds a treasure trove of data that can provide crucial insights into job markets and workplace experiences. However, before we can harness this wealth of information for analysis and decision-making, it is essential to address the challenges of data cleanliness and reliability. In this project, we embark on a journey of data cleaning, where we meticulously process and refine the data we've scraped from Glassdoor. By eliminating inconsistencies, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality, we aim to transform raw web data into a valuable resource for informed business and employment-related decisions."
